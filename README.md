# JavaScript_Learning
This repository documents my journey of learning JavaScript. Each day, I tackle a new concept and write a small program to reinforce my understanding.

## Learning Goals and Objectives

1. **Understand the basics of JavaScript**: Learn about variables, data types, functions, and control structures.
2. **Become proficient in DOM manipulation**: Learn how to interact with and modify web page content dynamically.
3. **Master asynchronous programming**: Understand Promises, async/await, and how to handle asynchronous operations.
4. **Write clean and maintainable code**: Follow best practices to write efficient and readable JavaScript code.

## Day-by-Day Learning

### Day 1: Variables and Data Types
**Concept:** Today, I learned about different data types in JavaScript such as strings, numbers, and booleans, and how to declare variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`.

**Example Program:**
```javascript
// Example: Variables and Data Types
let name = "John"; // String
const age = 30;   // Number
var isStudent = false; // Boolean

console.log(`Name: ${name}`);
console.log(`Age: ${age}`);
console.log(`Is Student: ${isStudent}`);
